### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--...-->

Some of the most interesting projects I've worked on are:
- [StyleCam](https://github.com/omduggineni/StyleCam): A real-time style transfer app for iOS which makes everything look like a painting.
- [Pholder](https://devpost.com/software/pholder): An AI-based photo search tool that uses a neural network to allow for semantic search of photos.

(there may or may not be an extremely-freqently-updated github repository that I use to write my notes in :D)
